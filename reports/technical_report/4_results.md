# 3. Results

This section presents the results of our analysis split into two sections. 

Section 1 focuses on the aggregate indicators stream of analysis where we use business descriptions from Glass and Google Search trends to generate sector rankings of exposure and opportunities for diversification from Covid-19 which we subsequently combine with official data in order to generate local estimates of share of the workforce exposed to and able to diversify from Covid-19.

Section 2 explores various avenues to generate firm-level measures of exposure / adaptation to Covid-19 through analyses of Covid-19 notices posted in business websites, by linking company websites to regularly updated social media feeds, and by looking for secondary sources of information about business outcomes (such as company dissolutions in Companies House) which could help us go from evidence about "exposure" to Covid-19 to objective measures of impact and its drivers.

## 1. Aggregate results

### a. Exposure to Covid-19

As discussed in the methodology, we have combined information from business websites and Google Search Trends in order to produce monthly sectoral rankings of exposure to Covid-19: sectors with very low levels of consumer interest compared to a pre-Covid-19 baseline are labelled as "high exposed". 

#### National exposure

[@fig:nat_evol] presents the evolution and composition of employment in sectors highly exposed to Covid-19 (decile 8 and above of exposure) between March 2020 and January 2021.

* The top panel presents aggregate shares of employment in Scotland and in the rest of the UK. It shows similar patterns of economic exposure to Covid-19 in terms of levels and evolution. We see spikes of exposure around the three main Covid-19 waves and associated lockdowns / policy restriction (March, October and Christmas 2020).
* The bottom panel presents the shares of employment in Scotland exposed to Covid-19 accounted for by different SIC sections (the [interactive version](link here) allows a more finely grained exploration at the SIC divisionslevel). The charts shows important changes in the composition of workforces exposed to the pandemic at different points: during the first lockdown a significant share of the exposed workforce was in *Health activities* (differently from subsequent lockdowns, specialist health services such as dentists etc. were forced to close over this period) and in *Construction*. In subsequent phases of th pandemic other sectors such as *Accommodation*, *Employment activities* and *Social work* as well as some professional services such as *Legal and accounting* account for a larger share of the workforce exposed to Covid-19.

![Evolution and composition of exposure to Covid-19](../../figures/scotland/png/national_exposure_evolution.png){#fig:nat_evol}

In chart [@fig:nat_comp] we consider the industrial composition of the Scottish economy together with levels of exposure to Covid-19 in different sectors ([interactive version here](link)). 

* The left panel focuses on the shares of employment in different divisions (ranked by their position in the SIC taxonomy) coloured by their level of exposure to Covid-19 in January 2021 (with red referring to high levels of exposure). It shows -unsurpringinsly - that the majority of employment is in Services, and that there is substantial variation in the level of exposure to Covid-19 (in January) across big employer sectors: Industries such as *Education* and *Retail trade* show low levels of exposure, while others such as *Accommodation* and *Food and Service activities* are highly exposed. *Human Health*, *Social Work* and *Public administration* sit somewhere in the middle, suggesting steady demand for their services despite the pandemic and social distancing. 

* The right panel shows the relative levels of specialisation measured with location quotients in those same divisions (we use a logarithmic scale to reduce the impact on the visualisation of primary sectors such as oil where Scotland has very high levels of specialisation). Our goal is to explore the extent to which sectors where Scotland has a revealed comparative advantage are exposed to Covid-19. 

  * The chart shows that most primary sectors that Scotland has a strong specialisation on such as *Fishing* and *Extraction of Crude Petroleum and Natural Gas* and *Mining Support Service activities* are not highly exposed to Covid-19
  * In Manufacturing, Scotland's two main areas of competitive advantage (*Manufacture of beverages* and *Electricity*) do not appear to be substantially exposed to Covid-19
  * In Services, Scotland is specialised in three sectors with high levels of exposure to Covid-19 - they are *Libraries and museums*, *Accommodation* and *Architectural and Engineering Activities*.

#### Local exposure

We display the evolution in the share of the workforce in sectors highly exposed to the pandemic in [@fig:ca_evol]. Each line corresponds to a council area and the colour of the lines represents the mean exposure share over the whole period [explore individual trends in the interactive](here). 

We see that the evolution of exposure to Covid-19 in council areas reflects the national trends in [@fig:nat_evol]: a spike in economic exposure from April slowly declining until August and restarting in September . In terms of individual council areas,  Council Areas in the highlands such as Argyll and Butte Perth and Kinross and Stirling, as well as some of the islands appear more highly exposed to Covid-19 with between 15% and 20% of the workforce in the highest exposed sectors at different points of the pandemic while council areas such as Clackmannanshire, Midlothian or East Renfrewshire appear less exposed.

![Evolution and composition of exposure to Covid-19](../../figures/scotland/png/exposure_trend_lads.png){#fig:ca_evol}

In the top panel of [@fig:ca_map] we display the geography of exposure to Covid-19 in selected months (April and September 2020 and January 2021) with warmer shades representing higher levels of exposure and cooler shades lower levels. The bottom panel shows the industrial composition of three council areas with high levels of exposure to Covid-19 at different times. The vertical axis in each of those charts display the decile of exposure to Covid 19 (with higher values representing stronger exposure) and the horizontal axis the share of employment in that decile. The colours of the bars display industries (SIC sections) ([more detailed SIC divisions can be explored in the interactive version](add link here)).

We see that:

* In April, the Highland council areas was strongly exposed to Covid-19 because of its reliance on *Accommodation**, *Wholesale and Retail trade of Automobiles* and *Specialised Construction Activities*.
* In September, Aberdeen appears strongly exposed to Covid-19 because of the importance of *Extraction of Crude, Petroleum and Gas*, *Exployment activities* and *Legal and Accounting activities* among other sectors.
* In January 2021, Stirling's high exposure to Covid-19 is explained by sectors such as *Employment activities*, *Accommodation* and *Libraries and Museums*. 

This illustrates the important variation in the economic drivers of local exposure to Covid-19 at different point of the pandemic, and the heterogeneity of local economies that are exposed.

### b. Diversification

#### Industry space and sector exposures

Having considered exposure to Covid-19 in Scotland and its local economies, we move on to consider opportunities for diversification from the pandemic based in our machine learning analysis of company descriptions. As described in Section 3, we can use similarities between industries (which we consider a proxy for opportunities for diversification between them) to draw an "industry space" where industries that are closer to each other are better able to diversify away from Covid-19. 

We present this industry space in [@fig:sector_space], where each node represents an industry, the size of the nodes captures their level of employment in Scotland according to BRES and their colour the level of exposure to Covid-19 in January 2021. [The interactive version of the chart](link here) can be used to explore the structure of the network (the industry that each node refers to and who are its neighbours - the industries that it is connected with and might be able to diversify into).

The figure illustrates some of the diversification opportunities / challenges for sectors that are highly exposed to Covid-19:

![Scottish sector space](../../figures/scotland/png/sector_space_Scotland.png){#fig:sector_space}.

* *Food and Beverage service activities* (in the south-west of the graph) is highly exposed to Covid-19 but neighbours several other less exposed industries such as *Manufacture of food products* or *Retail trade*.
* *Land transport activities* (towards the bottom of the graph) can diversify into *Postal and courier* activities. 
* *Creative arts and entertainment* (towards the top) can diversify into *Motion picture activities*.
* *Accommodation* activities is close to *Real Estate activities* - unfortunately this is a sector that appears as highly exposed to Covid-19 in January 2021.

In order to summarise a sector's diversification options away from Covid-19, we measure how far away it is, on average, from sectors with low levels of exposure to Covid-19. We present the results in Chart [@fig:div_option)[interactive version](link here). In that chart, the vertical axis represents SIC divisions sorted by their average distance to less exposed industries in January 2021, with industries farther apart from low levels of exposure at the top. The left panel captures the share of neihgbours with different levels of exposure and the right panel the total number of neighbours). The chart helps us to identify which are the industries that are most exposed to Covid-19 and potentially less able to diversify away from it. The workforces in those industries and the local economies that specialise on them will be specially exposed to Covid-19.

![Scottish sector space](../../figures/scotland/png/sector_diversification_options.png){#fig:div_options}.

Some of the sectors that are most exposed and least able to diversify away from Covid-19 include *Air transport*, *Activities of Households and other domestic personnel*, *Land transport*, *Creative arts and entertainment*, *Travel Agencies* and *Accommodation*. By contrast, other sectors that are relatively highly exposed to Covid-19 such as *Other professional activities not elsewhere classified*, *Services to Buildings and Landscaping activities* and *Architectural and Engineering activities* have a broader set of diversification options 


#### Evolution of diversification

In Figure [@fig:divnat] we show the evolution of shares of employment in sectors that are highly exposed to Covid-19 but have low diversification options (top panel) comparing Scotland with outside, and looking into the specific industries that are contributing to Scotland's high exposure (bottom panel). 

It shows that Scotland has a slightly higher share than the rest of the UK in sectors that are highly exposed to Covid-19 and have limited opportunities for diversification. These differences appear to be driven by the importance of *Accommodation*, *Libraries and Museums* and *Mining support activities* in Scotland compared to other parts of the UK. 

![Evolution of diversification](../../figures/scotland/png/div_trends.png){#fig:divnat}

In [@fig:localdiv] we map shares of employment in "high exposure - low diversification" sectors in council areas for selected months and council areas. The maps in the top panel suggest a degree of persistence in the council areas that appear more exposed to Covid-19 and less able to diversity from it - these are particularly in the Highlands. In the bottom panel we display the "industry spaces" for different council areas. The colour of the nodes show the exposure to Covid-19 of different industries and their size the local level of employment of those industries ([interactive version](add link here)). The figure illustrates the complex, shifting nature of exposure and vulnerability to Covid-19. 

* City of Edinburgh's relatively high share of employment in high exposure - low diversification sectors (10%) in April appears linked to the importance of *Accommodation* and *Finance and Insurance* related activities. 
* Highland's apparent vulnerability in September relates to the importance of *Accommodation* and *Warehousing and support activities for transportation*
* Aberdeenshire's high exposure in January is linked to the importance of *Mining support services* in the local economy.

### c. Links with other data

We conclude this part of our analysis by exploring the link between our measures of exposure / diversification options and other secondary variables about local economies as well as claimant count data providing a proxy for the economic impact of Covid-19. 

Our secondary variables include measures of the economic health of a location (employment rate and median annual gross income), level of education (including share of population with no qualifications and share with tertiary education) and a measure of economic complexity that captures the sophistication of the productive capabilities in a location [@bishop2019exploring].

Before exploring the link between all these variables, we present the evolution of normalised claimant count rates by council area in Scotland in [@fig:cl_scot] ([explore individual council area trends in the interactive version](link here)). The evolution of the series is consistent with the idea of a Covid-19 impact after March 2020 with an increase in claimant count rates *compared with the same month the year before* (we already noted that [@resfund2020truth] has raised potential issues with this data). 

When we check the evolution of individual council areas, we find that affluent council areas such as City of Edinburgh and Aberdeen City have experienced a stronger shock from Covid-19, with claimant count rates three times higher than the same month in the previous year). This supports the notion already highlighted during the literature review that the pandemic has had a stronger impact on urban and wealthy economies (although obviously this does not tell us anything about the extent to which different locations are able to whitstand the shock of the pandemic - deprived areas may find it more challenging to do this).

![Scottish sector space](../../figures/scotland/png/claimant_counts_Scotland.png){#fig:cl_scot}

This observation is further confirmed by the correlation matrix in [fig:corr_tab], where we present correlations between relevant variables in our data with a focus on Scottish council areas (warmer colour represent positive correlations). We find that:

* The normalised claimant count rate is positively correlated with measures of economic performance such as median annual gross salary, employment rate, meaasures of education such as the share of the population with a tertiary degree and measures of economic complexity that other research has shown are associated with productivity and technological development [@bishop2019exploring]. This variable is also positively (although weakly) correlated with our measure of the share of the population working in sectors that are highly exposed to Covid-19 in the current and prior months, and our measure of the share of the workforce employed in sectors that are highly exposed to Covid-19 but have low diversification opportunities.
* We note that the direction of the correlation coefficients between our secondary variables and a non-normalised claimant count rate capturing the rate of the workforce claiming unemployment benefits *irrespective of the situation before the pandemic* go in the opposite direction and are more weakly correlated with measures of exposure to Covid-19. 

![Scottish sector space](../../figures/scotland/png/correlation_table.png){#fig:corr_tab}

We explore further these patterns in [@fig:biv], where we visualise the bivariate association between our measures of exposure and diversification opportunities (focusing on current exposure instead of exposure in previous months) and secondary variables (we have . The colour of the points represent the normalised claimant count for a council area. We also display the slope of the regression coefficient between both variables and the $R^2$ coefficient (amount of variance in the variable in the vertical axes accounted by the variable in the horizontal axis). 

Although the relationships between variables are generally weak, we note with interest a positive link between our exposure measure to Covid-19 and the level of education (share of population with tertiary education). The same link is negative when we focus on exposure meaasures that consider only employment in sectors with less diversification options. One interpretation of this result is that council areas with more educated workforces are more exposed to Covid-19 but that a substantial part of this exposure is accounted for by industries that have more diversification options and might therefore be able to reduce the impacts of the pandemic ([see interactive version here](add link here)).

![Correlations between exposure / diversification shares and secondary data](../../figures/scotland/png/bivariate_scatters.png){#fig:biv}

The analysis above has highlighted the complexity of the interrelationships between our variables: wealthy and more educated council areas have experienced bigger increases in claimant counts compared to a pre-pandemic baseline. They appear to be somewhat more exposed to Covid-19 but in sectors that may be able to diversify into other industries less exposed to the pandemic. We incorporate all this information into a linear model where we regress our outcome variables (claimant counts and normalised clainmant counts any given month) on our measures of exposure to Covid-19 (both in the present month and lagged), other variables capturing local economic conditions such as employment rate, share of population with tertiary education and economic complextiy, and council area fixed effects to capture unobserved sources of heterogeneity. In [@fig:regression] we present the coefficients of association between outcomes and measures of exposure after adjusting for covariates as together with their confidence intervals.

![Scottish sector space](../../figures/scotland/png/modelling_results.png){#fig:regression}

The figure shows a generally significant and positive association between our measures of exposure to Covid-19 and claimant counts - in particular when normalised by the 2019 baseline - consistent with the idea that they are capturing relevant information about the economic impact of Covid-19 in local economies.
