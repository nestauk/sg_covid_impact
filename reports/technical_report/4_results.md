# 3. Results

This section presents the results of our analysis split into two sections. 

Section 1 focuses on the "aggregate indicators" stream of analysis where we use business descriptions from Glass and Google Search trends to generate sector rankings of exposure and opportunities for diversification from Covid-19 which we subsequently combine with official data in order to generate local estimates of share of the workforce exposed to Covid-19.

Section 2 explores various avenues to generate firm-level measures of exposure / adaptation to Covid-19 through analyses of Covid-19 notices posted in business websites, by linking company websites to regularly updated social media feeds, and by looking for secondary sources of information about business outcomes (such as company dissolutions in Companies House) which could help us go from evidence about "exposure" to Covid-19 to objective measures of impact and its drivers.

## 1. Aggregate results

### a. Exposure to Covid-19

As discussed in the methodology, we have combined information from business websites and Google Search Trends in order to produce monthly sectoral rankings of exposure to Covid-19: sectors with very low levels of consumer interest compared to a pre-Covid-19 baseline are identified as "high exposed". 

#### National exposure

[@fig:nat_evol] presents the evolution and composition of employment in sectors highly exposed to Covid-19 (decile 8 and above of exposure) between March 2020 and January 2021.

* The top panel presents aggregate shares of employment in Scotland and in the rest of the UK. It shows similar patterns of economic exposure to Covid-19 in terms of levels and evolution. We see spikes of exposure around the three main lockdowns (March, October and Christmas 2020).
* The bottom panel presents the shares of employment in Scotland exposed to Covid-19 accounted for by different SIC sections (the [interactive version](link here) allows a more finely grained exploration at the SIC divisionslevel). The charts shows important changes in the composition of workforces exposed to the pandemic at different points: during the first lockdown an important share of the exposed workforce was in *Health activities* (differently from subsequent lockdowns, specialist health services such as dentists etc. were forced to close over this period) and in *Construction*. In subsequent phases of th epandemic other sectors such as *Accommodation*, *Employment activities* and *Social work* as well as some professional services such as *Legal and accounting* will account for a larger share of the workforce exposed to Covid-19.

In chart [@fig:nat_comp] we consider the industrial composition of the Scottish economy together with levels of exposure to Covid-19 in different sectors ([interactive version here](link)). 

* The left panel focuses on the shares of employment in different divisions (ranked by their position in the SIC taxonomy) coloured by their level of exposure to Covid-19 in January 2021 (with red referring to high levels of exposure). It shows -unsurpringinsly - that the majority of employment is in Services, and that there is substantial variation in the level of exposure to Covid-19 (in January) across big employer sectors: Industries such as *Education*, *Retail trade* show low levels of exposure, while others such as *Accommodation* and *Food and Service activities* are highly exposed. *Human Health*, *Social Work* and *Public administration* sit somewhere in the middle, suggesting steady demand for their services despite the pandemic and social distancing. 

* The right panel shows the relative levels of specialisation measured with location quotients in those same divisions (we use a logarithmic scale to reduce the impact on the visualisation of primary sectors where Scotland has very high levels of specialisation). Our goal is to explore the extent to which sectors where Scotland has a revealed comparative advantage are exposed to Covid-19. 

  * The chart shows that most primary sectors that Scotland has a strong specialisation on such as *Fishing* and *Extraction of Crude Petroleum and Natural Gas* are not highly exposed to Covid-19, while *Mining Support Service activities* is. 
  * In Manufacturing, Scotland's two main areas of competitive advantage (*Manufacture of beverages* and *Electricity*) are not substantially exposed to Covid-19. 
  * In Services, Scotland is specialised in three sectors with high levels of exposure to Covid-19 - they are *Libraries and museums*, *Accommodation* and *Architectural and Engineering Activities*.
