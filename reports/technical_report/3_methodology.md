# 3. Data sources and methodology

This section describes the data we have collected and the methods we have deployed in its analysis in order to answer the following questions:

1. What is the role of business website and search data in generating new indicators about economic exposure to Covid-19 that add to what evidence is available from existing official and administrative sources? Here we are in particular interested in the technical feasibility of various approaches to data collection and processing, and on the quality of the resulting data in terms of coverage and accuracy.
2. What do the resulting indicators tell us about the impact of Covid-19 on Scotland? Here we are particularly interested in identifying what local economies / sector firms / firms in Scotland are most exposed to Covid-19, what are their opportunities for diversification and implications for policy.

We begin with a high level summary of our approach, followed by a detailed description of each of the data sources we have collected, how we have processed and their validation through triangulation with other sources and previous studies. All the code we have developed for data collection and analysis is available from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/nestauk/sg_covid_impact/).
