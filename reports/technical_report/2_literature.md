# 2. Literature

A large body of literature about the economic impact of Covid-19 has accumulated since the beginning of the pandemic. Here, we focus on a few generally UK-based exemplars that illustrate the range of data sources that economists are deploying to measure Covid-19's impact.

Having done this, we outline a few stylised facts about the impact of Covid-19 on Scotland's economy based on official statistics and other research which provides a baseline for our own analysis and conclude with our contribution.

## Official data

Three main types of official data have been leveraged to study economic exposure to Covid-19 and the impact of the pandemic. They are output data collected through business surveys to produce GDP statistics, business surveys about employment in different industries and locations, and labour market surveys with information about the characteristics of the workforce. 

An example of the former are the [GDP quarterly national accounts](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/bulletins/quarterlynationalaccounts/julytoseptember2020#quality-and-methodology) that the Office for National Statistics (ONS) published in December 2020 with information about GDP growth between July and September 2020. This analysis shows sectoral variation in GDP versus a pre-Covid 19 baseline which is qualitatively consistent with different industries' exposure to Covid-19-related lockdowns, travel bans and social distancing: Industries such as *Arts, Entertainment and Recreation* and *Accomodation and Food Services* have experienced significant drops in output (as much as 25% in September) compared to the pre-pandemic situation, while *Public Administration*, *Wholesale retail trade* and *Real Estate* were, in September 2020, at pre-pandemic levels of output.

One limitation of national accounts data is that is is not available at a high level of geographical resolution. One strategy to address this is to combine it with other estimates of sectoral exposure to Covid-19, for example based on changes in share prices and expert assessments in order to rank industries based on their vulnerability to Covid-19. These rankings can then be combined with sub-national sectoral employment data from, for example, the Business Register Employment Survey (BRES) in order to estimate the level of exposure to Covid-19 at the local level. The Centre for Cities take this approach in their [analysis of the economic implications of Covid-19 for British cities and large towns](https://www.centreforcities.org/blog/what-does-the-covid-19-crisis-mean-for-the-economies-of-british-cities-and-large-towns/)[@enenkel2020cities]. 

[This paper](https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/publications/supply-and-demand-shocks-in-the-covid-19-pandemic-an-industry-and-occupation-perspective/) illustrates how labour survey data is being used to analyse the impact of Covid-19. It analyses the job descriptions of  occupations to determine if they have been classified as "essential" (and therefore able to continue working during lockdown)[@del2020supply]. It also creates a Remote Labor Index that proxies the scope for working from home in different occupations. These measures of "supply shock" exposure to Covid-19 are combined with measures of "demand shock" based on expert assessments from previous pandemics in order to model the first-order economic impacts of Covid-19. An important result is that occupations with lower median salaries have limited opportunities to work from home, making them more exposed to Covid-19 in economic and health terms. This supports the idea that Covid-19 may further increase economic and health inequalities in society.


## Business panels

Business panels are regular voluntary surveys including small representative samples of firms. An example is the [Business Impact of Coronavirus Survey (BICS)](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/output/datasets/businessinsightsandimpactontheukeconomy), which is undertaken on a fortnightly basis and includes questions about company financial status, its resort to government policies put in place in response to the pandemic such as the Furlough Scheme, and expectations about the future. The most recent release of the survey, covering the period between the last week of December 2020 and the last week of January 2021 shows that 70% of businesses were currently trading, and that 55% of the businesses had seen their turnover decrease compared to what would have been expected in normal conditions. 

## Administrative data

One important source of administrative data being used to measure the impact of Covid-19 are the claimant count statistics available from ONS, capturing [Universal Credit and Job Seekers Allowance claimants](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/sources/cc) on a monthly basis. Since these benefits are primarily claimed for the reason of being unemployed, their evolution over time can help proxy the impacts of the pandemic. At the same time, and as [this report](https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/app/uploads/2020/07/The-truth-will-out.pdf) from the Resolution Foundation argues, this data source is not without its limitations: the beginning of the pandemic coincided with the roll out of Universal Credit, which may have artificially boosted the number of people included in claimant count statistics, and it may have included some individuals who were in fact supported through furloughs and the Self-Employment Income Support (SEIS) scheme [@resfund2020truth]. 

Notwithsatnding these issues, claimant count data's relatively high level of timeliness and geographical granularity (data are available for sub-national geographies such as the local authority districts) mean that are being widely used in analyses of the geography of Covid-19 impacts such as the Centre for Cities' [Covid-19 UK unemployment tracker](https://www.centreforcities.org/data/uk-unemployment-tracker/).

## 'Big' data

Big data from unconventional sources such as credit card transactions, smartphones and websites are increasingly being used to complement survey and administrative data. One reason for their appeal is their high level of granularity: in theory, the data capture the behaviour of individual economic agents such as consumers purchasing goods and services online, employers advertising for jobs or businesses describing their activities in their websites "in real-time", enabling the creation of detailed and timely micro-datasets to monitor the impact of Covid-19. 

Some examples uses of big data in the analysis of the pandemic include:

* [An analysis of the impact of the pandemic on purchasing patterns in Spain using credit card data](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3594273)[@carvalho2020tracking]. An interesting aspect of this study is that it uses information about the services being purchased (eg. transport) and the socio-demographic characteristics of different neighbourhoods where the expenditures take place to estimate levels of social distancing and exposure to Covid-19 in different social groups. 
* The ONS is drawing on credit card spending data from [CHAPS (Credit House Automated Payment System)](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/payment-and-settlement/chaps-faster-indicator) provided by the Bank of England to produce "faster" indicators of consumption in different categories of goods and services such as staples, work-related goods and services, social consumption and delayable.  
* The ONS is also using [online job advert data from Adzuna](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/methodologies/usingadzunadatatoderiveanindicatorofweeklyvacanciesexperimentalstatistics) to monitor the impact of Covid-19 on labour demand as part of its faster economic indicators. Indeed, another popular job portal, has published an [analysis of the impact of Covid-19 on labour demand in different countries](https://www.centralbank.ie/docs/default-source/publications/economic-letters/vol-2020-no-3-covid-19-and-the-global-labour-market-impact-on-job-postings-(adrjan-and-lydon).pdf) [@adrjan2020labour]. 
* Researchers at the ZEW centre for economic research in Mannheim [have collected Covid-19 notice data from business websites in Germany](http://ftp.zew.de/pub/zew-docs/ZEWKurzexpertisen/EN/ZEW_Shortexpertise2005.pdf) in order to analyse geographical and sectoral levels of exposure to the pandemic. As part of this, they analyse the content of the Covid-19 notices to determine if they are communicating changes (or no changes) in the business as well as problems being experienced. There are several other studies that use text analysis - for example of company statements -to measure firm-level exposure to Covid-19 [@hassan2020firm].


## Evidence about the economic impact of Covid-19 in Scotland

In December 2020, Scottish Government published a [comprehensive report about Covid-19's impact in Scotland](https://nationalperformance.gov.scot/sites/default/files/documents/NPF_Impact_of_COVID-19_December_2020.pdf) including a section about the impact on "the economy, fair work and business culture" which draws on similar sources to those we described above:

* BICS data from November shows that "Arts, Entertainment and Recreation" and "Accommodation and Food Services" have been most impacted by the pandemic, with 11% of the former and 38% of the latter temporarily closed. These sectors also have experienced the greatest decline in turnover and have the largest share of employees furloughed.
* The report features [an analysis by the Fraser Allander Institute](https://fraserofallander.org/mapping-local-job-vulnerability/) that combines information about the impact of Covid-19 on sectoral GDP in Scotland and information about the geography of sectoral employment to measure the vulnerability to Covid-19 in different parts of Scotland [@mcintyre2020vulnerability]. One important finding of this analysis is that while most of the jobs in "Accommodation and Food Services" (a big employer that is highly exposed to Covid-19 impacts) are in urban areas, these areas are more sectorally diversified and therefore likely to be resilient to the impact of Covid-19 than rural areas that rely on fewer industries.
* Claimant count data suggests that local authorities in Scotland that are more deprived have experienced higher increases in claimant count rates although there are exceptions such as Aberdeen City and City of Edinburgh which are relatively affluent yet have experienced strong growth in claimant counts. The report mentions [other studies](https://fraserofallander.org/latest-data-on-the-scottish-economy-update-9th-october-2020/) that, based on information about availability of vacancies, retail and recreation activity and workplace activity suggest that urban and wealthier areas are taking longer to return to their baseline of activity than rural and more deprived areas.
* In its analysis of labour market impacts, the report notes the high likelihood that Covid-19 will increase inequality because workers in lower paid occupations are particularly exposed to the pandemic. It also points out that the disruption of arts and cultural sector might increase barriers to wellbeing-enhancing cultural participation for economically disadvantaged groups.

## Synthesis

The data sources that we have outlined in this section have complementary strengths and weaknesses: official data are of high quality and capture economically important variables such as GDP or employment. An important downside is that they tend to be available with a lag and at a low level of sectoral and geographical resolution. Business surveys such as BICS are collected more regularly and include specific information about the impact of Covid-19 but are similarly coarse in sectoral and geographical terms. All these sources assume sectoral and geographical homogeneity in exposure and ability to respond to a shock, neglecting the fact that some firms or locations may have digital and innovation capabilities enabling them to adapt to the pandemic more easily than their competitors.

Administrative data from claimant counts are generated on a more timely basis and are available at the sub-national level but might be confounded by policy and administrative challenges. 

Big data are very timely and detailed, enabling the production of more granular evidence about the impact of the pandemic and potentially even firm-level estimates of exposure that take into account firm-specific responses. At the same time, they fail to capture directly policy-relevant economic variables (for example, business websites generally lack information about levels of employment in an organisation). There are also understandable concerns about biases in their geographical and sectoral coverage if, for example, multiple platforms are present in the market as is the case with online job ad portals. Adoption of digital technologies and use of online platforms is also likely to vary across sectors in ways that could skew their analysis. 

Next section describes in detail the strategy that we have adopted in order to harness the relative strengths and weaknesses of various data sources in order to measure economic exposure and opportunities to diversify from Covid-19 in Scotland.
